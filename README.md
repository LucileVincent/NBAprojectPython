# NBA data science report

As part of the Python Scripting module, we were asked to complete a project. In this one, we want to create code that retrieves data from the official NBA website, organizes it, and presents it in easy-to-read statistics. We decided to collect two types of data: data concerning the players such as age, assists, rebounds, number of matches played, the team to which they belong and data on the different teams like the previous one. We then had to imagine what we could get out of them and how to present them to the user of our program. A minimum of 5 graphics was requested.
You will therefore find in our graphic code, correlation, training and testing model, prediction, etc.
